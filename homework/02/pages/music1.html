		Well I've heard there was a secret chord <br>
That David played and it pleased the Lord <br>
But you don't really care for music, do you? <br>
Well it goes like this: <br>
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift <br>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof <br>
You saw her bathing on the roof <br>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya <br>
She tied you to her kitchen chair <br>
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair <br>
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah <br>
