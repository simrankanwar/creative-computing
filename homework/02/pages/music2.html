		LYRICS<br><br><br><br>
		Drink up, baby, stay up all night <br>
With the things you could do, you won't but you might <br>
The potential you'll be that you'll never see<br>
The promises you'll only make<br>
Drink up with me now and forget all about<br>
The pressure of days, do what I say<br>
And I'll make you okay and drive them away<br>
The images stuck in your head<br>
People you've been before that you<br>
Don't want around anymore<br>
That push and shove and won't bend to your will<br>
I'll keep them still<br>
Drink up, baby, look at the stars<br>
I'll kiss you again, between the bars<br>
Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air<br>
Waiting to finally be caught<br>
